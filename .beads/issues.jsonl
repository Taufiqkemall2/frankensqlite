{"id":"bd-urm","title":"Spec: TxnSlot claiming_timestamp stale during CLEANING takeover","description":"In §5.6.2 cleanup_orphaned_slots, a cleaner CASes txn_id -> TXN_ID_CLEANING and then stores claiming_timestamp=now. There is a window where another cleaner can observe txn_id==TXN_ID_CLEANING while claiming_timestamp still contains a stale value from the previous owner (Phase 1 claim time), causing spurious 'stuck CLEANING' takeover. Proposed fix: after Phase 3 publish CAS succeeds (TXN_ID_CLAIMING -> real_txn_id), clear claiming_timestamp to 0 (Release). This makes a future CLEANING transition start from 0, so concurrent cleaners seed a fresh timestamp via CAS(0->now) rather than treating stale timestamps as stuck.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:31:48.738087677Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-07T22:31:48.738087677Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}
